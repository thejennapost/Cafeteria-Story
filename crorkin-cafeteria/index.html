			If your child attends school in Brooklyn, you may want to consider sending a packed lunch. There is more than a 50 percent chance the cafeteria has a critical violation of the city’s health code, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to foodborne illness, including improper food-storage temperatures, unwashed food-contact surfaces and inadequate hand-washing stations.

The most common critical violation, which may not surprise many New Yorkers, is evidence of mice or live mice. Evidence of rats appears far less often, in only 13 of the city’s 2,135 schools.

				The figures reflect each school’s most recent inspection. Under New York City Health Code Article 81, schools are inspected at least once a year, and the results are made public. Parents can look up their child’s school <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/school-cafeteria-inspection-results.page" target="_blank">on the city’s website</a> to see whether it is among the 13 with evidence of rats. (A warning: at least one school in every borough shows evidence of rats.)	

			</p>


			<p>
				The overall rate of violations, including minor issues and more serious ones, is significantly lower in public schools. Seventy-eight percent of private schools have at least one violation, compared with 56 percent of public schools. The category of violation is also important when assessing risk. Public schools most often receive general violations, such as damaged garbage receptacles or missing hand-washing signs. These issues can reflect gaps in procedure but are less likely to lead to foodborne illness. Private schools also receive general violations most frequently, but critical violations occur at nearly the same rate, which raises the overall food-safety risk for private-school students.

			“As the largest school district in the nation, the health and safety of our students remains our top priority,” said Isla Gething, associate press secretary for NYC Public Schools. “Clean, safe environments are essential when providing 900,000 meals a day under the universal free school meals program, and we are proud of all our staff who work tirelessly to maintain these standards.” This year, under a new state law, free meals are available to all students in New York regardless of income.

			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to food-safety violations, inspectors monitor compliance with rules on artificial trans fat, cracked eggs, carbon monoxide and hair restraints. These checks are meant to ensure the most basic level of safety in school kitchens. The data makes clear, though, that families across the city may not always be getting that guarantee.
